            <p>And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life What do you 
                think you'd expect you would see? Just like a mirror reflecting the 
                moves of your life And in the river reflections of me
            </p>
            <p>
                Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see And in a movement he beckons 
                to me And in a moment the memories are all that remain And all the wounds are 
                reopening again
            </p>
